    "#### The 1919 Eclipse Expedition to test the light-bending prediction of General Relativity remains one of the most famous physics experiments of the 20th century. In 1801, J G von Soldner calculated, according to Newtonian theory, that the position of a star seen near the edge of the Sun should shift by 0.875 arcseconds relative to its position measured half a year later, when the Sun is elsewhere in the sky. However, Arthur Eddington measured this effect as 1.75′′ and confirmed Einsteins prediction during the solar eclipse in May 1919.\n",

    "### 4 Solving the Lens Equation\n",
    "#### One of the simplest ways to produce simulations of gravitational lenses is to use a parametric model, a procedure that turns out to be particularly well suited for computer simulations. In a parametric model, the mathematics and physics of a phenomenon are reasonably well understood, and the results of the simulations depend on the values of a number of variables, or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The toaster in your kitchen is an example of a parametric system with one parameter: the position of the lever that controls how dark you like your toast (e.g., light, brown, or burnt). Thanks to this parameter, you will not need different toasters to make different kinds of toast. The physics, mathematics, and engineering behind how toasters work (electricity coming on, elements heating up, etc.) do not change. The predictable result, your toast, depends only on the particular value of the model parameter, the position of the lever. With some trial and error, you can usually find an optimal parameter value that suits your taste. To produce simulations of gravitational lenses, we choose a deflecting mass distribution M(θ) and a distribution of light on the background source plane to observe through the lens. We will now investigate some imaging properties for the lens from previous problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (a) Think of a ray that would end up at the origin in the source plane. How many such rays could you think there are? Where do they originate?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are an infinite number of rays\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (b) Back to your computer (python will be great for this again). Consider an array of $N^2$ pixels. For example, the WFPC2 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope produces 800 × 800 pixel images with $\\Delta = 0.05′′$ (By comparison, the full moon is about 0.5 degrees or 1800 arcseconds across, nearly 50 times wider than the Hubbles field-of-view!) Shoot a ray through the center $\\theta$ of each of the $N^2$ pixels, calculate the deflection angle $\\alpha(\\theta)$, and solve the lens equation for the point $\\beta$ where the ray pierces the source plane. This is opposite to the direction the light travels through the lens, but this is valid because gravitational lenses show optical reciprocity: light travels the same way in both directions through the lens."
